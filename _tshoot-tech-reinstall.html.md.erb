To reinstall a tile in the same environment where it was previously uninstalled:

1. Ensure that the previous tile was correctly uninstalled as follows:
    1. `cf login` as an admin user.
    1. Run `cf m` and confirm that the Marketplace does not list <%=vars.service_name_article%>.
    1. `bosh login` as an admin user.
    1. Run `bosh deployments` and confirm that its output does not show a deployment for <%=vars.service_name_article%>. For example no `p-concourse-GUID` deployment exists.
1. Run the [`delete-all-service-instances`](#delete-all) errand to delete all instances of the service.
1. Run the [`deregister-broker`](#deregister-broker) errand to delete the service broker.
1. Run `bosh delete deployment YOUR-BROKER-DEPLOYMENT` to delete the service broker BOSH deployment.
1. Install the tile again.
