To determine whether there is an issue with <%=vars.service_name_article_full%> deployment, run `bosh vms`:

<pre class="terminal">
$ bosh vms --vitals service-instance_$guid
</pre>

For additional information, run `bosh instances`:

<pre class="terminal">
$ bosh instances --ps --vitals
</pre>

If the VM is failing. follow the service-specific information. Any unadvised corrective actions (such as running `bosh restart` on a VM) might cause issues in the service instance.
