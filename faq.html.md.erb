title: Data on Deployment Performance and Sizing for On-Demand Service Instances

This topic shows you test data on on-demand service instances managed in a deployment.

VMware tested the on-demand broker (<%= vars.product_abbr %>) with 500 on-demand service instances using
the [example Kafka on-demand tile](https://github.com/pivotal-cf-experimental/example-kafka-on-demand-tile).
We recorded how long it took to create, upgrade all, and delete all, with 50, 101,
and 500 dedicated service instances.
Setup and results are shown below.

## <a id="test_running"></a>Test

1. Upload the example Kafka on-demand tile.

1. Configure the on-demand plan.

1. Apply changes to install the on-demand service, ensuring that **Register
On-Demand Broker** is checked.

1. Create N dedicated service instances using the cf CLI.

1. Make a change to the plan configuration.

1. Apply pending changes, ensuring that **Upgrade All On-Demand Service Instances**
is checked.

1. Delete the tile and apply changes, ensuring that **Delete All On-Demand Service
Instances** is checked.

| total           | 04:17:38 | 08:31:10 | 41:38:26 |

These durations may vary for a number of reasons, for example:

- Number of BOSH director workers
- IaaS performance
- Network latency
- Service instance BOSH release(s)
- Service instance deployment configuration
- VM type of service instance
- Activity of Elastic Runtime
- Activity of BOSH Director

## <a id="test_notes"></a>Notes

For create operations, the on-demand broker creates a BOSH deployment for each service instance.
By default, the BOSH Director in <%= vars.ops_manager %> v1.9 has three workers with
a dedicated status worker, so only two workers are available to process deployment tasks.
Therefore, only two service instances can be created at the same time.

For upgrade all and delete all operations, <%= vars.ops_manager %> runs a BOSH errand.
This errand task occupies a BOSH Director worker, leaving one worker available to
upgrade, or delete deployments.
