## <a id="odb"></a>On-Demand Service Broker

The on-demand service broker is stateless, so there is nothing to backup or restore.

## <a id="service-instances"></a>On-Demand Service Instances

Service instances created by the on-demand service broker might have state that needs to be backed up, e.g. data services.

It is the responsibility of the Service Author to provide documentation for the operator to backup and restore on-demand service instances. For a list of deliverables provided by the Service Author, see [Required Deliverables](creating.html#what-is-required-of-the-service-authors).

## <a id="disaster-recovery"></a>Disaster Recovery

The on-demand service broker fetches the state of service instances and their deployments from the Cloud Foundry API and BOSH Director respectively. Therefore, to recover on-demand service instances in a disaster both the Cloud Controller database and BOSH Director database must be restored from a backup.
