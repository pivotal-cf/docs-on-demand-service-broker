title: Backup and Restore Considerations for On-Demand Services SDK
owner: London Services Enablement

This topic gives you information about which components of an on-demand service
have state and can be backed up.

## <a id="odb"></a>On-Demand Service Broker

The on-demand service broker is stateless, so there is nothing to backup or restore.

## <a id="service-instances"></a>On-Demand Service Instances

Service instances created by the on-demand service broker may have state that
needs to be backed up, for example, data services.

It is the responsibility of the service author to provide documentation for the
operator to backup and restore on-demand service instances.
For a list of deliverables provided by the service author, see
[Service Author Deliverables](creating.html#what-is-required-of-the-service-authors).

## <a id="disaster-recovery"></a>Disaster Recovery

The on-demand service broker fetches the state of service instances and their
deployments from the Cloud Foundry API and BOSH Director respectively.
Therefore, to recover on-demand service instances in a disaster both the Cloud
Controller database and BOSH Director database must be restored from a backup.

For how to backup and restore a deployment, see
[Backing up and restoring deployments](https://docs.vmware.com/en/Single-Sign-On-for-VMware-Tanzu-Application-Service/1.14/sso/GUID-backup-and-restore.html).
