### Resolved Issue

This release has the following fix:

* **Service instance creation no longer fails when using `authorization_code` grant type:**
When the UAA client is requested and the `authorization_code` grant type is defined,

Without this change, creating the service instance fails because UAA fails to
create the OAuth2 client for the service instance.
