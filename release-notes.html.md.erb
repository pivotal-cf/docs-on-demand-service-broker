## <a id="0.29.0"></a>v0.29.0

**Release Date: May 22, 2019**

<p class="note breaking"><strong>Breaking Change:</strong> If you set <code>cf_service_access</code> to <code>org-restricted</code> in the <code>
  register-broker</code> errand, you must set <code>service_access_org</code> in
  each plan in the broker service catalog.
For an example of a plan configured as <code>org-restricted</code>, see <a href="./management.html#register-broker">Register Broker</a>.</p>

<p class="note breaking"><strong>Breaking Change:</strong> You can no longer set service access for all plans with the <code>enable_service_access</code> property. This property has been removed. You must set service access for individual plans with <code>cf_service_access</code>. This property defaults to <code>enable</code>. For more information about configuring service access for plans, see <a href="./management.html#register-broker">Register Broker</a>.</p>

### Features

New features and changes in this release:

- The `register-broker` errand is no longer a bash script. It is now a golang binary. This enables the team to better test functionality and remove unnecessary dependencies. <%# Which team? %>
- `maintenance_info` includes a `version` property.
Platform operators can implement the functionality needed to expose this feature. For more information about this
feature, see [(Optional) Maintenance Info](operating.html#maintenance). <%# What does the second sentence mean? %>
- You can pass a `?force=true` query parameter to force delete a service instance. <%# For more information, see [SOMETHING]().%>

<%# The below needs to be on its own page. Also what does this mean:
If a BOSH service deployment becomes unresponsive and the broker's
standard delete request fails, passing `?force=true` as a query parameter to the
deprovision endpoint issues a force delete for the BOSH deployment.
In this case, the broker does its best to run any pre-delete errands configured
for the deployment. However, if the errand fails, the broker will ignore the
failure and continue with the next operation (the next pre-delete errand or the force deletion). %>
- Updates golang to v1.12.5.
