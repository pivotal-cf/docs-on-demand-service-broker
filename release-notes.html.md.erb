**Release Date: July 13, 2020**

<p class="note breaking">
  <strong>Breaking Change:</strong> The UAA client that the on-demand broker (ODB) uses to communicate
  with Cloud Foundry must have, at least, <code>clients.read</code> authority.
  For more information about this UAA client, see <a href="./operating.html#cloud-controller">Set Up Cloud Controller</a>.
</p>

### Features

New features and changes in this release:

* `cf.authentication` is now deprecated. For more information about the new format, see `cf.uaa` in
the broker [spec](https://github.com/pivotal-cf/on-demand-service-broker-release/blob/50391857a2d4d4fbc23c27303577aa532db88129/jobs/broker/spec#L133-L155) in GitHub.

* The on-demand broker now accepts a new configuration property: `cf.uaa.client_definition`.
For more information, see the broker
[spec](https://github.com/pivotal-cf/on-demand-service-broker-release/blob/master/jobs/broker/spec#L148-L155) in GitHub.<br>
When configured, the on-demand broker creates a UAA client for each service instance and passes the new client to
the service adapter when generating the manifest.
For more information, see [Create a Client on CF UAA](./operating.html#creating-uaa-client).
