This topic provides information for service authors about how to create a service
release for an on-demand service tile.

##<a id="what-is-required-of-the-service-authors"></a> Service Author Deliverables

Service authors provide the following:

- A Service Release to be deployed by the manifest that is generated by the Service Adapter. See
[Create a Service Release](#create-a-service-release) below.
- A Service Adapter. See [Creating a Service Adapter](./service-adapter.html).
- Documentation for the operator to configure plan definitions for the Service Adapter.
- Documentation for the operator to backup and restore service instances.

For information about the responsibilities of operators, see
[Operator Responsibilities](operating.html#operator-checklist).


## <a id="create-a-service-release"></a>Create a Service Release

A service release is a BOSH release that is deployed at instance creation time,
once for each service instance, by the on-demand broker (ODB).

### <a id="service-instance-lifecycle-errands"></a>Service Instance Lifecycle Errands

 <p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: This feature requires BOSH director v261 or later.</p>

A service release can provide job errands that are used by ODB during the management of an instance lifecycle.
Operators can configure service instance lifecycle errands.
For more information, see [Service Instance Lifecycle Errands](./operating.html#lifecycle-errands).

ODB supports the following service instance lifecycle errands:

- `post-deploy`: These errands run after the creation or updating of a service instance.
For information about the workflow, see [Create or Update Service Instance with Post-Deploy Errands](./concepts.html#post-deploy).
- `pre-delete`: These errands run before the deletion of a service instance.
For information about the workflow, see [Delete a Service Instance with Pre-Delete Errand](./concepts.html#pre-delete).

A deployment is only considered successful if along with the deployment all lifecycle errands complete successfully.

See an example implementation of a health check `post-deploy` job in the [example Redis release](https://github.com/pivotal-cf-experimental/redis-example-service-release/tree/master/jobs/health-check).

If you are using the `generate-manifest` command, you must validate and include
any supported errands that are specified in the instance groups array.
For more information about this command, see [generate-manifest](./adapter-reference.html#generate-manifest).

#### <a id="colocated-errands"></a>Colocated Errands

<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: This feature requires BOSH director v263 or later.</p>

Both `post-deploy` and `pre-delete` errands can be run as colocated errands.
Colocated errands run on an existing service instance group, avoiding additional resource allocation.

In order to enable a new colocated errand, they must be added to the list of jobs of an instance group.

For more information, see the [BOSH documentation](https://bosh.io/docs/errands.html).

### <a id="job-links"></a>Job Links

When generating a manifest, Pivotal recommends not using static IPs, which make
network IP management very complex.
Instead, Pivotal recommends using BOSH's job links feature.

There are two types of job links, implicit and explicit.
The [example Kafka release](https://github.com/pivotal-cf-experimental/kafka-example-service-release/blob/master/jobs/kafka_server/spec#L15)
uses implicit job links to get the IPs of the brokers and the zookeeper.
For more information about the links feature, see the [BOSH documentation](https://bosh.io/docs/links.html).

### <a id="package-service"></a>Packaging a Service Release

The service release should be packaged as a BOSH release, which should be colocated with the
ODB release in a BOSH manifest by the operator.

For examples of a service release, see the following:

* [Redis example service release](https://github.com/pivotal-cf-experimental/redis-example-service-release)
* [Kafka example service release](https://github.com/pivotal-cf-experimental/kafka-example-service-release)

For more information about how to create a BOSH release, see the [BOSH documentation](https://bosh.io/docs/create-release/).
Pivotal recommends creating sample manifests that deploy the service release(s),
because later this helps you write the `generate-manifest` component of the Service Adapter.
