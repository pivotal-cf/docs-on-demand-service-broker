Before BOSH 2.0, cloud operators pre-provisioned service instances from Ops Manager. In the Ops Manager Director **Networking** pane, they allocated a block of IP addresses for the service instance pool, and under **Resource Config** they provisioned pool VM resources, specifying the CPU, hard disk, and RAM they would use. All instances had to be provisioned at the same level. With each `create-service` request from a developer, Ops Manager handed out a static IP address from this block, and with each `delete-service` it cleaned up the VM and returned it to the available pool.

With BOSH 2.0 dynamic networking and Cloud Foundry asynchronous service provisioning, operators can now define a dynamically-provisioned service network that hosts instances more flexibly. The service network runs separate from the PCF default network. While the default network hosts VMs launched by Ops Manager, the VMs running in the service network are created and provisioned on-demand by BOSH, and BOSH lets the IaaS assign IP addresses to the service instance VMs. Each dynamic network attached to a job instance is typically represented as its own NIC (Network Interface Controller) in the IaaS layer.

Operators enable on-demand services when they deploy PCF, by creating one or more service networks in the Ops Manager Director **Create Networks** pane and selecting the **Service Network** checkbox. Designating a network as a service network prevents Ops Manager from creating VMs in the network, leaving instance creation to the underlying BOSH.
