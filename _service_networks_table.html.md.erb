Prior to deploying any service tile that uses the on-demand broker (ODB), the operator must request the network connections needed to allow various components of Pivotal Cloud Foundry (PCF) to communicate with ODB. The specifics of how to open those connections varies for each IaaS.

The following table shows the responsibilities of the key components in an on-demand architecture.

<table class="nice">
	<th>Key Components</th>
	<th>Their Responsibility</th>
	<tr>
		<td><strong>BOSH Director</strong></td>
		<td>Creates and updates service instances as instructed by ODB</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td><strong>BOSH Agent</strong></td>
		<td>BOSH includes an Agent on every VM that it deploys. The Agent listens for instructions from the Director and carries out those instructions. The Agent receives job specifications from the Director and uses them to assign a role, or Job, to the VM.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td><strong>BOSH UAA</strong></td>
		<td>As an OAuth2 provider, BOSH UAA issues tokens for clients to use when they act on behalf of BOSH users.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td><strong>ERT</strong></td>
		<td>Contains the apps that are consuming services</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td><strong>ODB</strong></td>
		<td>Instructs BOSH to create and updated services, and connects to services to create bindings</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td><strong>Deployed service instance</strong></td>
		<td>Runs the given data service (for example, the deployed Redis for PCF service instance runs the Redis for PCF data service)</td>
	</tr>
</table>

Regardless of the specific network layout, the operator must ensure network rules are set up so that connections are open as described in the table below.
