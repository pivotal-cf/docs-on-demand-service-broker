title: How On-Demand Services Process Commands

These sequence diagrams in this topic show how an on-demand service sets up and maintains service instances, indicating which tasks are undertaken by the on-demand broker (ODB) and which require interaction with the Service Adapter.

## <a id="catalog"></a>Register Service Broker with Cloud Foundry
<%= partial 'mmd/service_catalog_workflow.mmd' %>

## <a id="create-service-instance"></a>Create Service Instance

Note that there are two ways this can fail: synchronously and asynchronously. When it fails synchronously, the Cloud Controller will subsequently delete the service according to its [orphan mitigation strategy](http://docs.cloudfoundry.org/services/api.html#orphans). In the case when it fails asynchronously (e.g. while BOSH deploys the service instance), the Cloud Controller won't issue a delete request.

<%= partial 'mmd/create_service_workflow.mmd' %>

## <a id="delete-service-instance"></a>Delete Service Instance

In the delete service workflow the service adapter is not invoked.

<%= partial 'mmd/delete_service_workflow.mmd' %>

## <a id="post-deploy"></a>Create/Update Service Instance with Post-Deploy Errand

ODB will not report create/update succeeded to Cloud Foundry until both the deployment and post-deploy errand have completed successfully.

<%= partial 'mmd/create_post_deploy_workflow.mmd' %>

## <a id="pre-delete"></a>Delete Service Instance with Pre-Delete Errand

ODB will not report delete succeeded to Cloud Foundry until both the pre-delete errand and delete deployment have completed successfully.

<%= partial 'mmd/pre_delete_workflow.mmd' %>

## <a id="update-service-instance"></a>Update Service Instance

Updates can only proceed if the existing service instance is up-to-date. ODB calls `generate-manifest` on service adapter to determine whether there are any pending changes for the instance.

### <a id="update-service-instance-with-changes"></a>When There Are Pending Changes

<%= partial 'mmd/update_service_with_pending_changes_workflow.mmd' %>

### <a id="update-service-instance-no-changes"></a>When There Are No Pending Changes

The manifest from the second call to `generate-manifest` is deployed.

<%= partial 'mmd/update_service_no_pending_changes_workflow.mmd' %>

## <a id="upgrade-service-instance"></a>Upgrade Service Instance

<%= partial 'mmd/upgrade_service_workflow.mmd' %>

## <a id="bind"></a>Bind
<%= partial 'mmd/bind_service_workflow.mmd' %>

## <a id="unbind"></a>Unbind
<%= partial 'mmd/unbind_service_workflow.mmd' %>

## <a id="upgrade-all-instances"></a>Upgrade All Service Instances

ODB provides BOSH errand to upgrade all the instances managed by the broker. This can also be used in the scenario when a plan changes; this errand will update all instances that implement the plan with the new plan definition.

<%= partial 'mmd/upgrade_all_instances_workflow.mmd' %>

## <a id="delete-all-instances"></a>Delete All Service Instances

ODB provides BOSH errand to delete all the instances managed by the broker.

<%= partial 'mmd/delete_all_instances_workflow.mmd' %>
